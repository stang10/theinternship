This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.

## Weekly Coding Challenge From M&T Summer Engagement Journey

The instructions for the week's challenge was as follows:

```
This week, instead of us bringing you another movie you are going 
to have a chance to bring a movie to us. Your task for this challenge
is to make a single page website with HTML and CSS about anything 
movie related you want and host it on Github Pages. Some examples of 
sites you could make are: a webpage advertising a movie of your choice,
a webpage about a scene or character in a movie that you like, a webpage
about a faction in a movie, or anything else movie related that you want
to make a webpage about.
```

Our webpages were graded on the movie dedication, HTML and CSS usage, ARIA accessibility, and going above and beyond. Examples of going above and beyond included utillizing Javascript to enhance the website, utilizing an API, use of a Javascript framework such as React or Angular, use of a CSS extension language, and/or a streamlined UI.

My page utilized the Angular framework which helped to control the tabs that each displayed different information with the use of ngIf. Additionally, I made use of SCSS, a CSS extension language. My page was awarded the Superior Submission Award out of 9 participants.
