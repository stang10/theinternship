<p >The Internship follows Billy McMahon <span style="color:blue;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Vince Vaughn)</span> 
    and Nick Campbell <span style="color:red;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Owen Wilson)</span>, middle aged men feeling 
    outdated in the world around them. After being laid off, they seek out work in other fields. One unconventional 
    technical interview and a little help from some sympathetic judges later, these men embark on their journey as 
    "Nooglers" otherwise known as Google Interns.
</p>
<p>
    They spend the summer competing in teams against other interns in a variety of tasks in order to win guaranteed 
    jobs with Google. Billy and Nick are teamed with other interns seen as rejects: Stuart 
    <span style="color:green;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Dylan O’Brien)</span>, who is 
    incredibly sarcastic and attached to his smartphone; Yo-Yo <span style="color:blue;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Tobit Raphael)</span>, 
    who was home-schooled by his controlling mother; and Neha <span style="color:red;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Tira Sircar)</span>, 
    an enthusiastic but quirky lover of nerd culture. The team leader Lyle <span style="color:rgb(255, 191, 0);text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Josh Brener)</span> 
    constantly tries to act hip to hide his insecurities. Another intern, Ivy-League graduate Graham 
    <span style="color:blue;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Max Minghella)</span>, 
    bullies Billy and Nick's team. Roger Chetty <span style="color:green;text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px #000000">(Aasif Mandvi)</span>, 
    the head of the internship program, also expresses his 
    doubts about the older men's abilities. Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha see Billy and Nick as useless during a task focused 
    on debugging and send them on a wild-goose chase for the fictional Charles Xavier at Stanford University. But later, 
    during a game of quidditch against Graham's team, Billy rallies his team to a comeback that unifies them as a team, 
    despite ultimately losing after Graham cheats.
</p>
<p>
    When the teams are tasked with developing an app, Billy and Nick convince the team to indulge in a wild night out at 
    a strip club. Each of the characters grow closer together and reach far outside of their comfort zones.  At the end 
    of the night, Lyle's drunken antics inspire the team to create an app that guards against reckless phone usage while 
    drunk. They win the task by earning the most downloads. The movie then follows as Nick and Billy stumble onto a love 
    of the programming material they learn throughout the summer, risk their team’s chance at jobs, and ultimately earn 
    spots as members of the Google Workforce.
